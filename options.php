<div class="wrap">
  <h2>Pinterest for Galleries</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome! Actually there are no options, when this plugin is active (and it is now)
    under thumbnails of native WordPress galleries (inside posts) there will be a pin-it
    button.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plugin may not work with some kind of theme or other plugin: be patience and try
    to report me the issue.
